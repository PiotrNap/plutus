{- NOTE: [DeBruijjn index flat format]
In the debruijn branch we are transitioning the debruijn index to be a Word instead of Natural, for CEK performance reasons.

This means the types of `Script`,`Program`,`Term` change and so does the flat "interface".

This module tests that although the interface/types change,
the underlying flat encoding/decoding remains the same,
so there is no need to issue a new plutus language version increase.
